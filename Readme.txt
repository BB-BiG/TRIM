Data cleaning:
C source code: 'data_cleaning.c'
Executable code: 'data_cleaning'

i) What is does?

   The code is used to remove all the non-acgt charaters including annotationas and delimeters from a genome sequence. 

ii) System commands to do the task

   To compile the source code 'data_cleaning.c':    $gcc data_cleaning.c -o data_cleaning -DMAX=0 
  
   (The option -DMAX=0 indicates acgt characters in the sequence are kept unchanged)

   To run the executable code 'data_cleaning':   $./data_cleaning Genome.fna Genome.fna.txt

   'Genome.fna' is input file. It contains raw genome sequence that includes the non-acgt characters, annotationas and delimeters.
   
    The output will be stored in a file 'Genome.fna.txt' or any user specified filename, which will be the clean sequence containing only the acgt characters. 

Note: Cleaning genome sequence is mandatory for correct working of all other executables involved in following computations.

Computation of TRIM vectors 
C code: 'TRIM.c'
Executable code: 'TRIM'


i) What is does?

   Transforms genomic sequences into their corresponding TRIM vectors. Here, we assume that all the genome sequences 
   have been cleaned by the 'data_cleaning' utility.  
 
ii)  System commands to do the task

     To compile the source code 'TRIM.c':   $gcc TRIM.c -DMAX=3900000000 -lm -o TRIM

     (The option -DMAX indicates maximum length of genome the program will accomodate in RAM, which is presently 
     the maximum available genome length of the species taken from in NCBI repository under this study. 
     For any genome upto this length, user need not specify length of the experimenting sequence.)
 
     To run the executable code 'TRIM':   $./TRIM 
     
     A typical output instance

     Constructing TRIM vector for genome stored in file: Genome4.fna.txt
     Storing the TRIM vector in: TRIM_vector_Genome4.txt
     
     Note: The utility 'TRIM' automaically assigns the filename 'TRIM_vector_GenomeN.txt' and store the TRIM vector correspond 
     to the Nth input genome into that file. However, the input filename can be any user specified filename that contain a
     cleaned genomic sequence. In other words, the utility 'TRIM' will store the TRIM vector for the first input genome into
     TRIM_vector_Genome1.txt, the TRIM vector for the second input genome into TRIM_vector_Genome2.txt and so on.

Application: Phylogeny construction


We have used the distance-matrix based phylogney. There are two major steps in computation of distance-matrix based phylogney 

a) Computation of distance matrix. 

 C code: 'TRIM_distance_matrix.c'
 Executable code: 'TRIM_distance_matrix'

i) What is does?

   Computes TRIM distance matrix from a set of TRIM vectors. The TRIM vectors should be generated by using the utility 'TRIM'
   so that the files conatining the TRIM vectors have the apropriate naming convention i.e., 'TRIM_vector_GenomeN.txt'. 
   
 
ii)  System commands to do the task

     To compile the source code 'TRIM_distance_matrix.c':   $gcc TRIM_distance_matrix.c -lm -o TRIM_distance_matrix

     To run the executable code 'TRIM_distance_matrix':   $./TRIM_distance_matrix
     
     A typial output instance
     ........................................
     Enter the number of TRIM vectors to construct TRIM distance matrix: 12
     TRIM distance matrix is written into filename: TRIM_distance_matrix.txt
     
     
b) Contruction of phylogeny tree using hierarchical clustering algorithm NJ from the distance matrix.

  In this step we have used MATLAB to costruct the phylogeny tree from the distance matrix stored in 'TRIM_distance_matrix.txt'.
  The following MATLAB script will load the TRIM distance matrix from file 'TRIM_distance_matrix.txt' into a MATLAB variable 'D'
  
  .........................................
  >>myfile = 'TRIM_distance_matrix.txt';
  >>text = fileread(myfile);
  >>arr_text = strsplit(text);
  >>x = char(arr_text); x_n = str2num(x); x_n = x_n';
  >>D = x_n; 
  ...........................................
  
  From the distance matrix stored in varable 'D' we can construct the phylogeny tree using NJ method as 
  
  .....................................
  >>phy = seqneighjoin(D,'equivar');
  .....................................
  
  To get the Newick format of the phylogney tree we can use the following script
  .............................
  >>getnewickstr(phy)
  ............................
  
  From the newick formatted string we draw the phylogeny trees using MEGA 7.0. However, any other tools can be used.
  
  

Application: Taxa identification

C source code: 'Bagging_classifier_v1.c'
Executable code: 'TRIMEC'

i) What is does?

  It is used to identify the taxa of a given genome sequence and do not require any other inforation.
 
ii)  System commands to do the task

 To compile the source code 'TRIMEC.c': $gcc TRIMEC.c -DAMX=38900000000 lm -o TRIMEC
 
 To run the executable file 'TRIMEC': $./TRIMEC
 
 A typical instance of the TRIMEC is as 
 
 .......................................................

  and provided the instruction about how to use pre-built training in the taxa identification section. So user can skip this 
  steps.
